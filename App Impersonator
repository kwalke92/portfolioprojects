Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

create table basketball_practice 
(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
name TEXT, 
score NUMERIC, 
day TEXT); 

insert into basketball_practice (name, score, day) VALUES ("James", 50, "Wednesday"); 
insert into basketball_practice (name, score, day) VALUES ("Alex", 150, "Friday"); 
insert into basketball_practice (name, score, day) VALUES ("Arthur", 100, "Wednesday"); 
insert into basketball_practice (name, score, day) VALUES ("Brad", 250, "Friday"); 
insert into basketball_practice (name, score, day) VALUES ("Ricky", 150, "Wednesday"); 

update basketball_practice set score = 80 where id =3; 
select * from basketball_practice;

delete from basketball_practice where id = 5; 

select * from basketball_practice;
